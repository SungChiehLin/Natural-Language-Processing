# Research Goal

Customer feedback is a critical source of information for improving
operations in the hotel industry but capturing an accurate and complete picture of
the customer experience has always been a challenging task.
We’ll look at reviews from the hotel dataset, which is provided by
Datafiniti&#39;s Business Database. The goal of this study, we’ll train a machine
learning system to predict the star-rating of a review based only on its text. For
example, if the text says “Great! Best stay ever!!” we would expect a 5-star rating.
If the text says, “Scared to stay there again”, we would expect a 1-star rating.
Rather than writing many rules to check whether some text is positive or negative,
we can train a machine learning classifier to “learn” the difference between
positive and negative reviews by giving it labeled examples.


# Motivation
Come up with three questions and we made three applications in this project.

• What can we help hotel owners to understand customers’ needs. 

• How can we assist customers to discover the hotel that they want to stay. 

• What is the consumers most concern about a hotel?


# Solution
• Provided hotel owners an actual sentiment analysis on hotel reviews. 
  - Categorize reviews into positive & negative are important  
• Recommend Hotel to fit customers’ needs 
  - Since too many options to make decisions 
• Assisted hotel owners to predict authentic hotel ratings. 
  - Customers might misclick the ratings to fit their reviews

We recommend hotel based on customer need:

  - Since too many hotels to make decisions to stay for vacation.

# compared different model in sentiment analysis

We were testing which model is the best to predict sentiment analysis.
